                  During my time at Jumbo, I had the pleasure of working alongside amazing colleagues who helped me grow both personally and professionally. From managing my time effectively to finding the perfect balance between having fun and working hard, I learned many important skills that I carry with me today. <br><br>
                  Perhaps most importantly, my experience at Jumbo helped me to develop a greater sense of confidence in my ability to communicate effectively with others. Whether it was working with clients or collaborating with coworkers, I learned how to articulate my ideas and express myself with clarity and confidence.<br><br>
                  Overall, my time at Jumbo was an invaluable experience that helped me to develop a range of skills and qualities that I bring to the table as an employee. I look forward to applying what I have learned and continuing to grow in my professional life.<br><br>

                  During my time at Dwise, I had the opportunity to work with Wordpress, which was my first exposure to this popular platform. While I found Wordpress to be an interesting tool, I also discovered that it wasn't my preferred framework when compared to others that I have worked with.<br><br>
                  However, my experience at Dwise taught me a valuable lesson that I still carry with me today - the importance of asking yourself "why". It's not enough to simply know how to use a particular tool or framework. You also need to understand why you're using it and why you're using it in a particular way.<br><br>
                  By asking these important questions, I was able to gain a deeper understanding of the development process and become a more skilled and thoughtful developer. I am confident that my experience and skills will be an asset to any team.<br><br>
